# BasicShooter

A small shooter game in which the user can set how many enemies they would like to spawn.

The player is given a minute to shoot down enemies, at the end of which, stats will be displayed

## Stats
Stats displayed are total enemies destroyed, shots taken, shots missed, and overall accuracy

## Note
Ensure you are clicked away from the "restart" button before using spacebar to shoot, otherwise the browser will assume
you are using space to click the button and restart.

## Pitfalls
The game does not take into account speed at which the enemies come on screen, therefore, it is possible to add more enemies than the 
game will be able to spawn in within the given time limit.
